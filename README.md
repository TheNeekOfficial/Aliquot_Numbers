Just a project I've made to see how many iterations it takes to get to the end of numbers aliquot sequences. 

An Aliquot Sequence, is where you get all the factors of a number except the number itself and add them together, and keep repeating that until you reach 1, 0 or a loop

My code literally does just that, finds the factors of the numbers, adds them together and does it again until those breaking points, where it returns a print message of the no. of iterations it took to get to the end
It also looks for if the values are in specific lists, one of which `unknown` is a list of values we don't know the endpoint of when we follow its aliquot sequence. Don't edit those as those have all been thoroughly tested for using supercomputers. 
The second one `avoid` is a list I made to avoid really large values that do end, change that if you wish.

I did this, originally as test code after watching a youtube video about them, and then kept improving it as I viewed it as fun and interesting.

No idea what this could be used for but its fun to play around with and see the results
